# Tetris

This was created using the [p5.js library](https://p5js.org).  This is inspired by [Meth Meth Method](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8A0M0eDttdB11MHxX58vXQ)'s very own [tetris implementation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2aW5V46khA&t=9s). My implementation utilizes object-oriented programming, while his takes a functional approach.

The goal is to allow the player to adjust many different aspects of gameplay, such as grid size, how many pieces ahead they can see, if they play with a hold, different graphics, different piece randomizing algorithms, and different modes that would emulate different games.  For example, the user could play with scoring like it was on the NES version of Tetris or play the infamous dissapearing pieces from Tetris: The Grand Master (the third installment or something).
