# Tetris

This was created using the [p5.js library](https://p5js.org).  This is inspired by [Meth Meth Method](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8A0M0eDttdB11MHxX58vXQ)'s very own [tetris implementation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2aW5V46khA&t=9s). My implementation utilizes object-oriented programming, while his takes a functional approach.

The current implementation has some bugs, but works for the most-part.
